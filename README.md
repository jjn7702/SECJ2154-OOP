# Object Oriented Programming (SECJ2154)

Welcome to the Course on Object Oriented Programming! This course will present the concepts of object orientation and object-oriented programming techniques using Java programming language. It provides students with a thorough look at the basic constructs of the Java programming language such as its basic data types and operations. It also emphasizes on the use of standard Java APIs that allow students to develop text-based and GUI applications. It will also provide the programming techniques on exception handling and input/output files. At the end of this course, students should be able to use the basic constructs in object-oriented programming.

## Course Overview 📚

- **Course Duration:** 15 weeks
- **Prerequisites:** Programming Technique 1 and Programming Technique 2

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLO) 🎯
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Apply OOP concepts in problem solving and develop Java applications.
2. Develop Java applications that leverage the object-oriented features of the Java language such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in a given time frame.
3. Work in a team to develop a medium to complex program as a group mini project using Java programming language.

## Program Learning Outcomes (PLO) 🌟
This course contributes to the following Program Learning Outcomes:

- PLO1: Ability to acquire theory and principles of computer science and equip with social science and personal development knowledge.
- PLO3: Ability to creatively solve real world problems through computer science principles using current tools and techniques.
- PLO5: Ability to think critically and creatively in order to solve problems.

### Introduction to Object-oriented Concepts

- [Object Oriented Definition](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)
- Object oriented concept
  > Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career[^1^][1]. OOP is the most popular programming paradigm used for software development and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmer’s educational career[^1^][1]. OOP refers to languages that use objects in programming[^2^][2]. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming[^2^][2]. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function[^2^][2]. Key concepts of OOP include classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction[^3^][3]. #Source: 1. [Educative](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming); 2.
